##2016-01-29 - Pete Brown <pete@abstractit.com.au> 2.2.0
###Summary

Move puppetmaster config setup from puppetdb profile into master profile.

manage_virtualenv variable wasn't being used in puppetboard profile. @gwarf
preferred_serialization_format wasn't being reverted if it wasn't set to msgpack. Thanks to @topei for spotting this.

##2015-07-08 - Pete Brown <pete@abstractit.com.au> 2.1.0
###Summary

This version adds basic autosigning functionaliy which ignores the current  autosign parameter.

Autosigning is now managed with the autosign_method, autosign_file and autosign_domains variables.

Given that autosigning  didn't enabled autosign in a production environment it won't break any of your current production environments with default setings.

Add option for setting a ca_server.
Add option to set preferred_serialization_format for testing msgpack
